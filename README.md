# SPG Web App 1.5 

## Getting Started 

```
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

This will open up the [Astro](https://astro.build) app on localhost:3000


## ðŸš€ Plans

This is just a playground. Nothing serious. 

1. I am planning to rebuild Jonathon's wireframes in Astro. 

2. For now, I don't think we need React or Vue or anything. We can do this all with `.html` and `.astro`. 

3. If this goes good, I want to deploy it and see what this looks like in the real world. It should be the same as the https://spg.dev/ website, but with no styling and no `mp3` katha files. 

## ðŸ§ž Other Useful Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
